## Welcome!

This is my 2D openGL game that I am solo developing for entertainment and educational purposes. I used a premade starting template called "Glitter" to help get things up and running faster. If you would like to know more about Glitter then please read along as I include some information about it as well as links to their website. 


## Summary
Glitter is a dead simple boilerplate for OpenGL, intended as a starting point for the tutorials on [learnopengl.com](http://www.learnopengl.com) and [open.gl](https://open.gl). Glitter compiles and statically links every required library, so you can jump right into doing what you probably want. # [Glitter](http://polytonic.github.io/Glitter/)

Glitter provides the most basic windowing example. It is a starting point, and tries very hard not to enforce any sort of directory structure. Glitter bundles most of the dependencies needed to implement a basic rendering engine. This includes:
